Chronos
=======

A dynamic online visualisation of historical research into dialogue &amp; dialectical games

About
-----
Chronos provides resources for working with timelines of research as it develops over time. It was motivated by doctoral work carried out by [Simon Wells] and a static version of the vizualisation will be available in an upcoming Journal of Applied Logic publication.

However, because research in this area is ongoing, an online version is preferable which can be amended to reflect new important work in the area.

View the dynamically generated online timeline of [dialogue game research].

I'm [Simon Wells] and I'm a splendid chap.
