        <h3>About Chronos</h3>
        <p>The Chronos project seeks to provide high-quality, reproducible visualisations of timelines of scientific and academic research. The initial topic is the development of dialectical and dialogue games used in Argumentation Theory. This work stemmed from research initiated by Simon Wells in his doctoral studies, and subsequently published in a Journal of Applied Logic paper (in press, 2012). Whilst the journal paper contains a static visualisation of the timeline, research continues and obscure but important papers are still coming to light. This is why a dynamic, online repository of timeline research is required and Chronos seeks to satisfy that requirement.</p>

        <h3>The Visualisations</h3>

            </ul>
      
        <h3>Authors and Contributors</h3>
        <p>The visualisation and timeline work was initiated by, Simon Wells (<a href="https://github.com/siwells" class="user-mention">@siwells</a>). If you would like to contribute then there are a number of ways. The simplest, but which creates the most work for Simon, is to email him with suggestions. Another, more preferable, approach is to use the facilities of GitHub, either by creating an issue, or by cloning the repo, making your changes and issuing a pull request.

        <h3>Support or Contact</h3> 
        <p>Having trouble with the visualisation or want to contribute to it?
